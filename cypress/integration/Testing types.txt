---STABILITY AND RESPONCE TIME NOTED WHEN SOME LOAD PUTING ==> THIS VARIES THE TESTING TYPES---
STABILITY ==> CHECK THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE WITHSTAND BY IT ( )
RESPONCE TIME ==> CHECK THE TIME IS SAME FOR EVERY ONE OR CHANGES TO OTHER PEOPLE IT IS A RESPONCE TIME 
PERFORMANCE TESTING ==> PERFORMANCE TESTING MEANS INVESTINGATE , MEASURE,UPDATE AND VERIFY THE LOAD 


1) LOAD TESTING ==> WE CHECK THE STABILITY AND THE RESPONCE TIME  ( J METER IS USED FOE LOAD TESTING)
2) STRESS TESTING ==> WE CHECK THE IMP THING WHICH IS RESPONCE TIME ( WHEN WE INCRESE USER RESPONCE TIME ALSO INCRESE THAT TIME WE CALLED IT IS STRESS TESTING)
3) SOAK TESTING ==> FOR EXAMPLE WE PUT 5000 USER AND CHECK THE ENDURANNCE/ TIME AND CHECK WEATHER ITS WORKING GOOD OR NOT
4)SPIKE TESTING ==> IT IS CHECKING WHEN SUDDENLY USEWR INCREASES FOR A CERTAIN TIME
5)VOLUME TESTING ==> WE PUT HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA TO TEST THE application
6)STABILITY TESTING ==> EX WE SCALE UP AND SCALE DOWN THE USERS
